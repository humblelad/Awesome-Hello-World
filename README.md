# Basic-HTML-Page
In this repo you will be getting a to know what it is like to see a very basic HTML page and all the tidbits involved in it.

And furthermore, we will proceed with how a basic CSS code looks like.

At the end, the repo will give a small basic intro to Javascript coding and some php stuff. 

**Remember that all will contain very basic stuff; probably that of a simple Hello World. The main aim of the repo is not to teach coding but to show how the basic overview of the said languages work.**

Thanks for stopping by!
