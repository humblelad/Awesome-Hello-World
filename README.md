# Awesome-Hello-World
In this repo you will be getting  to know what it is like to see a very basic Hello world and all the tidbits involved in it.

At the end, the repo will give a small basic intro to Javascript coding and some php stuff. 

**Remember that all will contain very basic stuff; probably that of a simple Hello World. The main aim of the repo is not to teach coding but to show how the basic overview of the said languages work.**

Thanks for stopping by!

PS: I am trying to include "Hello world of all major programming  languages on earth! Sounds Weird after all.
